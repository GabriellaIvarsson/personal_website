
<h3>The Wedding</h3>
<div id="textInPage">
As we both like the 50's and 60's very much we have chosen to have it as our wedding theme. We would love it if you dressed according to this era, but it is not a must! 
<br/><br/>
Our ceremony, dinner and party will all be held at Kurorten M&ouml;sseberg in Falk&ouml;ping, Sweden.<br/>
13-07-13 at 1:07 PM
<br/><br/>
Our wish is to have a child free wedding, excluding our nieces and nephews.
<h4>RSVP</h4>
Please inform us if you are bringing a +1, if you are coming the day before and if you have any allergies/special diets.<br/>
